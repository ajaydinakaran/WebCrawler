# WebCrawler
Sample project

Copy src to your project src
add war/web-inf/lib to your buildpath
copy the contents under war to your Webapp folder

home page is localhost:8080/webcrawler

once you click on the "Link here to Crawl your application" ,it will crawl all your pages in your local and display it in the page .
src has test package which will run junit test cases.

Note: Since i had little time ,i did not use maven project .if i use maven project ,i can keep the test classes under src/test/java.

and also if i crawl other pages ,it is taking more time to complete so i decided to crawl our localhost .It is more of POC
